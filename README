Gameplan refers to two things, one of which refers to many things.

Firstly, you will (eventually) find here game-planning tools.
Prototypes, asset builders, dialog editors, stuff that helps plan games.

Secondly, the game itself, "Gameplan", a new take on role-playing games using
multiple interfaces, multiple devices, and multiple kinds of storytelling.
The plan is to build and maintain the game using mainly the game-planning
tools kept here, though related services and content may grow beyond this
repository.

Everything you find here, you're free to do with as you please as outlined by
the GPLv3.

Nothing you find here takes itself seriously.
